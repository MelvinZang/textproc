OVERVIEW

This code does some very simple pre-processing of raw text in order to
prepare nice inputs to topic modeling code.  

Before building with 'mvn package', call getmodels.sh to download
required OpenNLP model files (used for tokenization and sentence
detection).


USAGE

java -jar textproc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
followed by COMMAND ARG1 ARG2 ...


COMMANDS

counts - how many unique vocab terms you *would* have at wordcount thresholds
 foo.doclist (input)  full paths to the raw text files
 50          (input)  max threshold to consider 
 foo.counts  (output) will contain vocabulary sizes at various thresholds     

makestop - make stoplist of rarely occurring words
 foo.doclist (input)  full paths to the raw text files
 50          (input)  occurrence threshold 
 foo.stop    (output) will contain terms occuring < thresh times

makevocab - construct vocabulary 
 foo.doclist (input)  full paths to the raw text files
 foo.stop    (input)  stoplist, one word per line
 foo.vocab   (output) foo.vocab will contain vocabulary, one word per line

makecorpus - construct actual corpus files        
 foo.doclist (input)  full paths to the raw text files
 foo.vocab   (input)  vocabulary, one word per line
 foo         (output) will create corpus files: *.words, *.docs, *.sent

docfilter - filter documents down to those containing ALL terms of interest
 foo.doclist  (input)  full paths to the raw text files
